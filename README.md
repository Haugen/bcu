# bcu, the Branch Cleaner Upper

Tired of manually cleaning up and deleting your local git branches? I know, me too. `bcu` aims to be a simple programs that makes selecting and deleting git branches a breeze.

TODO:
- `make` file to handle build steps
- semantic versioning and release process
- handle exiting branch selection
- handle proceeding without selecting any branch
- confirmation prompt before running `git branch -D`
